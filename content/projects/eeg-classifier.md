id: 35
---
- Implemented and trained various deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Convolutional Recurrent Neural Networks (CRNN), and Convolutional Transformer (Conformer) models, tailored for EEG signal classification.
- Utilized the BCI Competition IV Dataset 2a for model training and validation, achieving test classification accuracies that exceeded the traditional benchmark of 69.43% by at least 1.5%.
- Implemented nontrivial data augmentation and a novel CNN architecture to reach a peak test accuracy of 74.97% over 50 epochs.
- Technologies: Python, PyTorch
