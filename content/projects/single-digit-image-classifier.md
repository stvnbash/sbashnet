- Collaborated on a team of 2 to develop and train a neural network digit classifier on the MNIST dataset in Python with PyTorch using Google Colab
- Achieved 97.68% accuracy using four fully connected layers, the Cross Entropy Loss function, and the Adam optimizer
- Presentation to discuss design rationale, layers used, how we trained it, iterations, and our training/testing accuracies
