Hi there, in December 2011, when I was just ten years old, I was diagnosed with celiac disease. What is this you may ask? Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder similar to affecting my small intestine [see the image below üò≥]. Let's back up a bit.  An autoimmune disorder is where the body attacks itself.  Some common autoimmune disorders include psoriasis, type 1 diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis.  With celiac, when I eat gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley, my small intestine attacks itself, preventing me from properly absorbing my nutrients! Crazy, right? That's why it's imperative that all of us with celiac disease maintain a strict gluten free diet!
![Your small intestine is lined with tiny hairlike projections called villi, which absorb vitamins, minerals and other nutrients from the food you eat. Celiac disease damages the villi, leaving your body unable to absorb nutrients necessary for health and growth.](https://www.mayoclinic.org/-/media/kcms/gbs/patient-consumer/images/2013/08/26/10/49/ds00319_im04515_mcdc7_celiac_diseasethu_jpg.jpg)

You might notice my use of the word strict (and diet) both of which sound scary. Not to fear, just follow along. So I can't eat any foods with wheat, rye, or barley. Luckily we live in the 21st century where foods are labeled, but are they really? Currently, the USA only requires labelling of wheat, not rye or barley. So, a lot of times, I'm taking a shot in the dark, while blindfolded. As you can see [here](https://farrp.unl.edu/IRChart), the USA has fallen behind almost every other developed country in terms of food labeling--it's a shame. But, the [Gluten Free Certification Organization](https://gfco.org/) has taken the lead in accurately labeling foods. The problem is that this is voluntary, so many foods that might be gluten free aren't labeled.

But there's another issue as well: cross contact. Imagine if your friend is eating pretzels while you're eating your delicious gluten free snack. Then your friend wants to try some of your snack, so they reach their hand into your bag. Uh oh! Now if you eat any more of your snack, you might end up with a stomach ache or worse! So, what happened? Gluten is a particle, and we measure the amount of gluten in foods in parts per million (ppm). According to [Northwestern University](https://groups.molbiosci.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-P/parts_per_million.html), "One ppm is equivalent to 1 milligram of something per liter of water (mg/l) or 1 milligram of something per kilogram soil (mg/kg)." That's really, really small! So your friend had gluten from their pretzels on their hands when they reached into your gluten free snack bag, therefore putting your food into contact with gluten (hence the term cross contact). You can avoid this situation by (1) asking your friend to wash their hands before reaching into your snack or (2) my preferred solution, reach into the bag yourself and hand them the snack directly.

But wait, there's more! I'm crying too! Let's replace these snack bags with a kitchen. How can you keep both gluten and gluten free items in the same kitchen? It's incredibly difficult. Many celiacs opt to seldom eat at restaurants because it's very hard to prevent cross contact in such a chaotic environment. Similarly, entire households go gluten free for this reason. Did mine though? Of course not! We like to be difficult. So we (aka my mom) spends HOURS cleaning the kitchen as she switches between cooking gluten and gluten free meals and cleaning up the gluten mess the rest of the family created. Yes, this is even more time consuming than you're probably thinking.

So, that sums up celiac, right? Not exactly... So, remember how I said that the USA doesn't require labelling of rye or barley? This applies to EVERYTHING, not just food. Let's say I need an antibiotic. I go to the doctor, they send my prescription to the pharmacy, and the pharmacy fills it. The pharmacy has my profile, so they're able to check that it's safe for me to take, right? NOPE! Since there are no labelling requirements, we have no idea if the medication is safe. So I (again, aka my mom) needs to call the manufacturer of the drug. Most are based on the east coast, which is incredibly inconvenient when they close at 2pm PST and worse, when you do get a representative on the phone, they have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA if it's gluten free, and I'm assuming they don't know what gluten is either. Ever heard of an [NDC Number](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/development-approval-process-drugs/national-drug-code-database-background-information)? According to the FDA, "Each listed drug product listed is assigned a unique 10-digit, 3-segment number. This number, known as the NDC, identifies the labeler, product, and trade package size. The first segment, the labeler code, is assigned by the FDA." When we (like I do this üòÇ) call the manufacturer, they ask for this number. So I (üòÇ) need to call the pharmacy first, explain that I have celiac etc..., get the NDC number, call the manufacturer, wait for a response, then IF the medication is gluten free, have the pharmacy fill the prescription. But what if it's not? Hopefully there's another manufacturer that is? Otherwise, I need to ask my doctor to prescribe a different medicine. Again, a very time consuming process, especially when the need for medicine is immediate. Did you notice that sounds extremely tedious and time consuming. Don't worry...it is!

Now try having to do this for everything, all the way down to the body wash and shampoo you use in the shower! That's my life! So are you wondering if it's a miracle I'm able to stay gluten free? Well it's not exactly a miracle as I'm very diligent, almost exclusively eat food cooked at home, and almost never eat from restaurants. I don't want to harm my body and I don't want any of the associated symptoms.

In Fall 2022, I started at UCLA.  I had high hopes they would be able to feed me.  After multiple meetings with the chef, they said they would prepare separate food for me to limit risk of cross contamination.  In the beginning, all seemed good.  It sucked being limited to one dining hall and not having the freedom of choice EVERY OTHER STUDENT HAD, but I was content with what I was able to eat.  That didn't last long though.  In the span of a week, I had at least three stomach aches, something I seldom, if ever, got.  I stopped eating from the dining halls and my mom started bringing me a weeks worth of food at a time.  But, the stomach aches continued.  I didn't feel right.  I was crashing after just eating.  I was off.  In late October 2022, we confirmed via bloodwork UCLA glutened me.  This triggered my ADHD and a while myriad of other symptoms and I've been dealing with the aftermath ever since.
